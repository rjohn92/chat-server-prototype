# **Project Objective & Scope**

## **1. Project Title**

**CNO Foundations: Documented Echo/Chat Server (C, Networking, RE, and
Exploitation)**

## **2. Project Motivation: Why Build This?**

**2.1. Industry Context:** 
Modern CNO (Computer Network Operations) analysts and programmers are
expected to understand:

- Low-level system programming (C, assembly, memory management)

- Networking (TCP/IP, sockets, client-server models)

- Reverse engineering and exploitation (buffer overflows, disassembly,
  firmware, malware analysis)

- Real-world system vulnerabilities and mitigations

**2.2. Learning by Building:** 
Instead of abstract textbook theory, this project is a bottom-up
practical implementation:

- **Start:** Minimal, fully documented echo server (Python then C) to
  demystify the networking stack and memory model

- **Iterate:** Add features and vulnerabilities intentionally, then
  patch/fix/defend/attack

- **End Goal:** Gain the technical fluency necessary to recognize,
  exploit, and defend against common vulnerabilities in real-world
  systems

## **3. What is a Chat/Echo Server?**

- **Definition:**   
  An **echo server** is a minimal network service that listens for
  connections, receives messages from clients, and sends the exact
  same message back. A **chat server** extends this by supporting
  communication between multiple clients, allowing users to send
  messages that other users can receive.

- **Components:**  

  - **Server:** Listens for connections on a network socket, receives
    data, and manages connected clients.

  - **Client:** Connects to the server and sends/receives messages.

  - **Socket:** Abstraction provided by the OS to enable data exchange
    over a network (usually TCP/IP).

  - **Protocol:** Rules for how data is formatted and exchanged (usually simple: raw text or binary messages).

- **Why it matters:**  

  - It is the canonical “hello world” for network programming—forcing
    you to understand sockets, processes/threads, and memory.

  - It provides a natural path to explore and exploit common
    vulnerabilities (buffer overflow, race condition, auth flaws).

  - Nearly every “real” CNO target will have some network-facing
    process; understanding the anatomy of such servers is critical.

## **4. What Will This Project Do?**

**3.1. Phase 1: Minimal Echo Server (Python → C)**

- A simple TCP server that listens for messages from a client and echoes them back

- Focus: Understanding sockets, the TCP lifecycle, and basic client-server interaction

**3.2. Phase 2: Expand to Chat Server**

- Support for multiple clients, message broadcasting, basic session handling, simple authentication

- Focus: Threading, synchronization, resource management, common pitfalls in C

**3.3. Phase 3: Vulnerability Exploration**

- Deliberately introduce, then mitigate, vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, race conditions)

- Analyze compiled binaries (using Ghidra) to link code → assembly → ecurity impact

**3.4. Phase 4: Reverse Engineering and Hardening**

- Use Ghidra to step through **disassembly**. Disassembly is the process of translating a compiled binary back into assembly code (human-readable machine instructions).of our own binaries

- Harden the code, document findings, apply lessons learned to firmware/malware samples

## **5. Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Languages: **

  - Python (for initial prototypes, reference implementations)

  - C (for core implementation, memory management, vulnerability work)

- **Development OS:  

  - Linux (Ubuntu or similar for host/dev; Raspberry Pi for ARM/embedded xposure)

- **RE & Analysis Tools:**

  - Ghidra (reverse engineering/disassembly)

  - gdb (debugging)

  - hexdump, objdump, strace (inspection and tracing)

- **Networking:  
  **

  - TCP sockets (IPv4 focus initially)

  - Wireshark/tcpdump (traffic inspection)

- **(Optionally, later) Virtualization/Segmentation:**

  - Docker/LXC or QEMU for safe sandboxes

  - VLAN or physically isolated subnet (for safe exploit testing)

## **5. Audience / Expected Skill Level**

- **Primary:**

  - Yourself: DevOps/SWE background, limited C/C++/assembly exposure,
    learning networking and low-level topics from scratch

- **Secondary:**

  - Other new grads, career pivoters, or anyone seeking a rigorous CNO
    skill foundation with step-by-step justifications and no skipped
    context

## **7. Documentation Philosophy**

- **Zero Assumptions:**

  - Every prerequisite (Linux basics, C toolchain, networking, Python,
    Ghidra install) is documented and justified

- **Modular:**

  - Each phase/feature stands alone and is checkpointed (so you can
    verify at every stage before layering complexity)

- **Debuggable & Observable:**

  - Every build/run step outputs something observable; debugging and
    inspection are built-in, not bolted on

- **Open to Change:**

  - This document is expected to evolve, reflect mistakes, lessons
    learned, and growing skill over time

## **8. Security/Isolation Decisions: Home Network vs. Segmentation**

### **7.1. Home Network Placement**

- **Risks:**

  - Any server (even "harmless" code) could be accidentally vulnerable.
    If it’s on your main LAN, an exploit or misconfiguration could
    expose your devices.

- **Recommendation (Best Practice):**

  - **Option 1:** *Initial Dev/Testing*: Use localhost-only (127.0.0.1,
    not 0.0.0.0) for all socket binds to avoid external exposure.

  - **Option 2:** *LAN Testing*: If you want to connect from other devices, use a separate VLAN or a physically isolated subnet (many
    home routers support guest networks, or you can use a cheap
    separate router).

    - **How-To:**  

      - Create a **Virtual Local Area Network** (VLAN) on your router
        (if supported). A VLAN is a logical segmentation of a physical
        network. Multiple VLANs can share the same switch/hardware,
        but devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly
        unless allowed by firewall/router rules.

      - Set up a separate WiFi network, or

      - Connect the Raspberry Pi to a different router

    - **Justification:**

      - Limits blast radius. If you accidentally expose something, only
        devices on that network are at risk.

  - **Option 3:** *Virtualization*: Use a VM or container with its own
    virtual NIC on an isolated virtual network. This is easiest with
    tools like VirtualBox/VMWare or Docker bridge networks.
